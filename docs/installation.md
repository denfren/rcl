# Installation

## With Cargo

Although Cargo is not a system package manager, if you have it available itâ€™s
an easy way to try <abbr>RCL</abbr>:

    cargo +1.70.0 install --git https://github.com/ruuda/rcl.git rcl

## From source

To build from source, clone the repository from one of the two mirrors:

    git clone https://github.com/ruuda/rcl.git
    git clone https://codeberg.org/ruuda/rcl.git

RCL is written in Rust and builds with [Cargo][cargo]. The repository includes a
`rust-toolchain.toml` file that specifies a compatible Rust version. When Cargo
is managed by [Rustup][rustup], it will automatically fetch the right toolchain.
To build:

    cargo build --release

Put the binary on your `PATH` to be able to use it system-wide, e.g.:

    cp target/release/rcl ~/.local/bin

[cargo]:  https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/guide/
[rustup]: https://rust-lang.github.io/rustup/index.html

## Python module from source

To build the Python module, follow the steps as before, but build the `pyrcl`
directory:

    cargo build --release --manifest-path pyrcl/Cargo.toml

Then rename `libpyrcl.so` to `rcl.so` so that Python can discover it, and copy
it to a location on the `PYTHONPATH`, e.g.:

    cp target/release/libpyrcl.so ./rcl.so

Now you can use the module as any regular one:

    $ python3
    >>> import rcl
    >>> rcl.loads("10 + 32")
    42

It is also possible to build a wheel that can be installed into a virtualenv
using [Maturin](https://www.maturin.rs/).

## As a Nix flake

The repository includes a Nix flake. It is mainly used to provide a suitable
environment for local development and CI, but it also includes the application
itself. You can run <abbr>RCL</abbr> with a [flake-enabled][flakes] version of
[Nix][nix], such as Nix 2.18:

    nix run github:ruuda/rcl -- --help

[flakes]: https://nixos.org/manual/nix/stable/command-ref/new-cli/nix3-flake
[nix]:    https://nixos.org/download

The Nix flake also includes the Python module:

    PYTHONPATH=$(nix build github:ruuda/rcl#pyrcl --print-out-paths)/lib python3
