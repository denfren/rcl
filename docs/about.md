# About RCL

RCL started as a hobby project, not so much because existing configuration
languages were inadequate, but because reinventing wheels is fun, it’s a nice
way to learn, and it is very rewarding to build something that does _exactly_
what you need in _exactly_ the way you prefer, even when an existing tool could
do a good-enough job of it. For more background, see the blog post,
[_A reasonable configuration language_][reasonable].
